Project Explanation – Guess the Number Game

The Guess the Number program is a simple Java game designed to let the user guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The main goal of this project is to build logic using conditional statements, loops, and user input handling in Java.

The program starts by generating a random number using the Random class and then allows the player to make guesses through the Scanner class. After each guess, the program provides hints — telling the player whether their guess is too high or too low. The player gets a total of 7 attempts to find the correct number. 

If the user guesses it correctly, a congratulatory message is shown; otherwise, the program reveals the actual number after all attempts are used.

This mini-project was built using Java, using only basic tools like Scanner for input and Random for number generation. It demonstrates key programming concepts such as loops, conditional logic, user interaction, and randomization.

Overall, the outcome of this project is an engaging console-based game that enhances problem-solving skills and introduces beginners to the core logic-building process in Java.
